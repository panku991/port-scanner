# Simple Port Scanner

This is a simple Python script for scanning a target IP address and listing its open ports.

# Installation

The script requires Python 3.x and the socket library, which should be installed by default. No further installation steps are required.

# Usage

To scan a target IP address and list its open ports, run the simple_port_scanner.py script with the IP address as the only argument:


python simple_port_scanner.py <ip_address>


The script will scan all ports on the specified IP address and print a list of open ports.



# Example

Here's an example of running the script to scan the IP address 192.168.0.1:


python portscanner.py 192.168.0.1


The output might look like this:


Open ports on 192.168.0.1:
22
80
443
